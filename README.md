This project I did for my Semantic Web Technologies and Knowledge Graphs module consisted of several tasks, including creating new ontologies from an existing Excel file, 
involves a comprehensive application of knowledge graph creation and manipulation, focusing on ontology modeling, RDF (Resource Description Framework) transformation, SPARQL querying, ontology alignment, and ontology embeddings. 

Ontology Modelling (20%)
Developed axioms using Protégé or text for ontology modeling, including atomic subsumption, universal and existential restrictions, unions, intersections, and equivalence axioms with cardinality restrictions. 
This task showcased the ability to define complex relationships and constraints within a domain-specific ontology.

Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Transformation (40%)
Automated the transformation of tabular data from a Pizza Restaurants dataset into RDF triples, using a predefined ontology as the vocabulary guide, as well as ontologies from Google and Wikidata KG
This involved URI generation for individual entities, RDF generation to create a semantic representation of data, and integration with state-of-the-art knowledge graphs for enhanced entity recognition.

SPARQL Querying and Reasoning (20%)
Wrote and executed SPARQL queries to interact with the created knowledge graph, demonstrating proficiency in data retrieval using filters, functions, union patterns, negation, and aggregates. 
Applied reasoning to extend the graph, illustrating the ability to infer new knowledge from existing data.

Ontology Alignment (10%)
Performed alignment between a provided pizza.owl ontology and the project-specific ontology, establishing equivalences between entities. 
This facilitated the interoperability of data and queries across different ontological frameworks, highlighting skills in semantic web technologies and data integration.

Ontology Embeddings (10%)
Utilized OWL2Vec* to generate ontology embeddings, capturing the semantics of the ontology and the data. Experimented with different configurations to analyze the similarity and dissimilarity between entity pairs, 
which could be applied in machine learning models for advanced ontology alignment tasks.
